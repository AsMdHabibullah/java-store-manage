# Java OOP(Object Oriented Programming) concepts and maven project setup

## Default java or spacific version of java, jdk, & maven install
### Editor install, OS path setup and connect to github

### Module of Java programming language
```
    1. vairable
    2. data type
    3. statement
    4. condition
    5. function/method
    6. class & object
    7. inheritance
    8. polymorphism
    9. abstraction
    10.encapsulution
    11.interface
```

### 01. variable
```
data type, var name
ex: int a, b, c;
```
### 02. data type
```
number
byte,
char,
double,
bolean [true, false]
```
### 03. statement
```
true
false
<
>
!<
!>
===
!=
```
### 04. condition
```
if
else
else if
swtch
catch
```

### 05. function/method
```
greed(khabar){
khabar process
}
```

### 06. class & object
```
Class & object is nothing but we can think it's one kinde of container where we can store so many information.
```

### 07. inheritance
```
Inheritance meansce we have a class or object that is also call super class or super object and this super class we can call to any others class and we can marge bothe is one class.
```

### 08. polymorphism
```
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a super class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
```

### 9. abstraction
```
It's unimplimennted super class method and this method must need be impliment when chiled class will call the super class.
```

### 10. encapsulution
```
Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. T
```

### 11. interface
```
An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to the class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.
```

## This project setup according to the maven architecture
```
Install maven accourding to the OS and for setup the maven project need to write some terminal command or need to create manualy from the editor. In my case I'm using Linux and thats whty I'm using command line terminal.

    ## Command
    01. sudo apt update
    02. sudo apt install maven
    03. mvn -version
    04. sudo apt update
    05. sudo apt install default-jdk
    06. java -version
    ##  Done maven and java instalation
    ##  Create maven project
    01. mvn --version
    02. mvn archetype:generate
    # Creation done maven project and maven will be genarate a pom.xml file and this file will contain all the dependancy of the project.
```

### After all now you can write the java code.
